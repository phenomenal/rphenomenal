        The project was started in the context of our master thesis at 
        %acronym{:title=>"UniversitÃ© Catholique de Louvain"} UCL 
        and we hope that it will still alive after this.
        Our goals in not only to implement a
        %acronym{:title=>"Context Oriented Programming"} COP
        framework but also to provide graceful integration in ruby on rails application to proof that
        %acronym{:title=>"Context Oriented Programming"} COP
        leads to better and lighter code.
      %p
        In that way, we will also provide some refactoring to bring non-context oriented applications to context-oriented applications.
        The next phase of the project is to work side by side with Belighted (A society specialized in
        %acronym{:title=>"Ruby on Rails"} ROR
        application) to apply and validate our considerations in one of their application.
      %p
        So, our work is first to develop the framework 
        %tt phenomenal 
        gem that allow
        %acronym{:title=>"Context Oriented Programming"} COP
        in Ruby application and then
        %tt phenomenal-rails 
        that will embed the glue for the
        %acronym{:title=>"Ruby on Rails"} ROR
        web framework.
