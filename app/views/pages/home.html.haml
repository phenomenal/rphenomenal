%h3 What we do
The project was started in the context of our master thesis at UCL and we hope that it will still alive after this. Our goals in not only to implement a COP framework but also to provide graceful integration in ruby on rails application to proof that COP leads to best and lighter code. In that way, we also have to provide some refactoring to port non-context oriented applications to context-oriented application.The next phase of the project is to work side by side with Belighted (A society specialized in ROR application) to apply and validate our considerations in one of their application.

  paradigms to the Ruby language and is developed by Lo√Øc Vigneron and Thibault Poncelet in the context of their master thesis.
  Beside the

  gem we will also provide
