      This thesis introduces the Phenomenal Gem, a 
      %acronym{:title=>"Context-Oriented Programming"} COP
      framework for the dynamic programming language Ruby. With this framework, programmers can handle contexts as first-class entities allowing them to adapt the behaviour of their applications dynamically in a clean and structured manner. In addition to this 
      %acronym{:title=>"Context-Oriented Programming"} COP 
      framework, the thesis also introduces the notion of 
      %acronym{:title=>"Context as a Feature"} CaaF 
      that tries to merge the best of 
      %acronym{:title=>"Context-Oriented Programming"} COP
      and 
      %acronym{:title=>"Feature-Oriented Programming"} FOP 
      into a single new paradigm. From the point of view of usability in todayâ€™s web application, this thesis builds the notion of 
      %acronym{:title=>"Feature as a Service"} FaaS 
      on top of 
      %acronym{:title=>"Context as a Feature"} CaaF
      , and integrates it in the Ruby on Rails web framework. The implementation and semantics of these concepts are presented in detail and validated by a real-world case study of a 
      %acronym{:title=>"Software as a Service"} SaaS
      %acronym{:title=>"Enterprise Resource Planning"} ERP 
      application, developed by an industrial collaborator.
