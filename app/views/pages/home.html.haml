%h3 Our project
%p
  The project was started in the context of our master thesis at 
  %acronym{:title=>"UniversitÃ© Catholique de Louvain"} UCL 
  and we hope that it will still alive after this.
  Our goals in not only to implement a
  %acronym{:title=>"Context Oriented Programming"} COP
  framework but also to provide graceful integration in ruby on rails application to proof that
  %acronym{:title=>"Context Oriented Programming"} COP
  leads to better and lighter code.
%p
  In that way, we will also provide some refactoring to bring non-context oriented applications to context-oriented applications.
  The next phase of the project is to work side by side with Belighted (A society specialized in
  %acronym{:title=>"Ruby on Rails"} ROR
  application) to apply and validate our considerations in one of their application.
%p
  So, our work is first to develop the framework 
  %tt phenomenal 
  gem that allow
  %acronym{:title=>"Context Oriented Programming"} COP
  in Ruby application and then
  %tt phenomenal-rails 
  that will embed the glue for the
  %acronym{:title=>"Ruby on Rails"} ROR
  web framework.
