Fractals is a library for creating fractal images in your Ruby programs. It
currently renders the Burning Ship, Julia Set, Mandelbrot, and Newton fractals
using the Escape Time or Normalized Iteration Count algorithm. The Themes
module contains a few predefined coloring palettes, but the Fractal type will
also accept any user-defined algorithm or theme.

Changes:
  There have been a few changes since version 1.1.0.  I've removed
  most of the duplicate code, added Procs where appropriate, and
  made the syntax more consistent.  The result is much more
  readable and should be easier to maintain.

  1.  The source code has been split into multiple files.  One for
      each module.
  2.  Each of the fractals has been distilled to a single block
      passed to the Fractal base class' constructor.  This makes
      it easy to construct new orbits fractals by either
      inheriting from Fractal or instantiating it directly.
  3.  Classes have been added for the Burning Ship and Newton
      fractals.
  4.  A 'Winter' theme has been added.
  5.  ChunkyPNG, PNG, RMagick and JRuby each have their
      own renderer.  Be sure to install the proper dependencies
      before using the PNG, RMagick, or JRuby renderers.
  6.  bailout and max_iterations are no longer constructor
      parameters.  This is the biggest breaking change.
  7.  Unit tests have been added for each fractal.
  8.  Several rake tasks have been added to make installation and
      gem creation easier.
  9.  ChunkyPNG is now the default renderer, but can be overridden
      using the renderer= method.

  See the documentation for a complete API reference.

Installation:
  sudo gem install fractals

Installing from source:
  svn checkout http://svn.ryanbaxter.net/fractals/tags/release-1.2.2 fractals-1.2.2
  cd fractals-1.2.2
  rake install

*Be sure to install the proper dependencies before using the PNG, RMagick, or
JRuby renderers.

Using Fractals:
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'fractals'

  mandelbrot = Fractals::Mandelbrot.new
  mandelbrot.write

Examples can be found in the examples.rb file.  Uncomment the fractal you'd like
to create before running.
